Qasim is a software engineer and entrepreneur who loves writing clean, test-driven Ruby and ES6 code—wrapped in perfectly crafted containers for CI/CD. 

In his free time, he authors technical content, tinkers with personal projects. He co-founded a (defunct) start-up, sometimes rides a dual-sport bike, goes hiking, and has summitted several mountains, including one active volcano.
